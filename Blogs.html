                Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a security framework that
                controls and manages user identities and access to systems,
                applications, and data. It includes key processes like authentication,
                authorization, user provisioning, and access governance. IAM ensures
                secure access, enhances compliance, and protects sensitive information
                across on-premise and cloud environments.
